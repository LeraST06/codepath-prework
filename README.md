## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

**College friend-matching app**
Making friends on campus can be pretty hard and sometimes even unsafe. My app would be a campus-only friend-matching app that helps students meet the right people. People would complete a survey about their personality, interests, and habits. After that, they would see a list of people with similar characteristics and a button that would take them to a in-app chat with the selected person. Access would be limited to verified students from the same campus to keep the community safe. 


## Notes

Challenges:
- figuring out new layout (slightly different from the given example due to an update).
- naming the IBAction wrong and figuring out how to fix it.
